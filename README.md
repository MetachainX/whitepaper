# Introduction

Astrotopia is a game that takes place in a distant future, where humanity has already joined advanced civilizations and discovered new forms of technology beyond our wildest dreams. As a commander in Astrotopia, you are responsible for piloting your spaceship through a vast and endless universe, exploring new planets and gathering valuable resources to upgrade your ship and become stronger.

The game mechanics in Astrotopia are designed to be simple yet engaging, allowing players to level up, upgrade their ships, craft new upgrades, engage in combat, and trade on an open marketplace. All of the game's assets, stories, and customizable elements are generated by powerful AI, ensuring that the game always feels fresh and exciting.

In Astrotopia, players have the opportunity to own planets and extract valuable resources from them, allowing them to build their wealth and expand their influence in the game world. The only limitation to what you can create is your own coding skills, as everything in Astrotopia is governed by Solidity code.

As you progress through the game, you'll have the chance to join The Galactic Federation, and work together with other players to achieve your goals. And with no cap on progression, the possibilities in Astrotopia are endless.

But Astrotopia is not just a game - it's a fully immersive experience designed to teach players everything there is to know about Web3 and blockchain technology. By playing and interacting with the game's many features, you'll be able to learn valuable skills and become a Web3 expert in no time.

Astrotopia is built by the community, for the community and it will be free to play on Sepolia testnet chain.
