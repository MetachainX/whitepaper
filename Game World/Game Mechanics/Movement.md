Movement within the game refers to the process of spaceships changing their location within the game's space. 

Spaceships can move through the game's space by committing to travel for a certain number of Ethereum blocks, with their distance of travel determined by their spaceship's statistics and the game's World Laws. 

Movement may also involve the use of other objects within the game, such as Quantum Portals, to allow for faster or more efficient travel. The ability to move and explore the game's space is an essential component of the game and is necessary for completing various objectives and discovering new areas within the game.
