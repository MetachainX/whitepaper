In this game, the single unit of time is defined as **one Ethereum block**, and all other functions are based on this concept. 

Time is experienced through the progression of Ethereum blocks. Each block represents a unit of time and marks the advancement of the game's state. As blocks are added to the blockchain, the game's state is updated accordingly, allowing for the execution of various functions and actions within the game. 

As example, users can commit their spaceships to travel for a certain number of blocks, which determines the duration of their journey in the game. Therefore, the experience of time in the game is closely tied to the Ethereum blockchain and its block time.
