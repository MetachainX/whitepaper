The universe was a vast and wondrous place, filled with wonders and secrets that were yet to be discovered. And at the center of it all were the Engineers, a race of advanced beings who wielded the power of the cosmos itself.

These Engineers were the architects of the universe, using their incredible powers to shape and mold reality into something beautiful and new. They existed in higher dimensions, far beyond the comprehension of human mind, and their powers were truly beyond measure.

One of the greatest creations of the Engineers were the Trade Centers, massive structures that float serenely among the stars and served as the hub of interstellar commerce. These centers were the heart of the galaxy's economy, connecting countless worlds and civilizations and facilitating the exchange of goods and knowledge.

The Engineers were the owners of the advanced artifact technology that made these Trade Centers possible. These artifacts were the product of eons of research and experimentation, and they were capable of incredible feats that were beyond the understanding of mere mortals.
